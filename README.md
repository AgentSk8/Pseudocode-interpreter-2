# Pseudocode-interpreter
##Â README 2
An interpreter written in C++ which uses slightly modified rules for pseudocode from the IGCSE Cambridge Computer Science standard so students (including me) can run and test their pseudocode which is also assessed in the exam without having to write it out in another language.

Done as part of DofE Bronze Award skill.
