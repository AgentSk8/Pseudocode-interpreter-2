# Pseudocode-interpreter-2
### A second edition of my pseudocode interpreter, now in c++.
I do not normally use GitHub or git. However, since I am going to be working long on this project (I hope) I wanted to not only be able to keep track, but to also use the new github codespaces.
You can find my first attempt at https://repl.it/@DavidRaibaut/pseudocodeinterpreter-V4 where I used very dirty and not very reliable python (it went through four iterations and didn't lex or parse the code.

**NOTE:** I actually started this on my desktop, so I have already created the base interpreter, parser and lexer for just the math, but since it is quite dirty I will try to clean it up. That is why there won't be many pulls requests or whatever you call them for the first few lines.
